
# TypeScript
This repository is a fork of [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) for my own personal use! (you will require it if you want to work on some of my open source projects).

There are no docs yet, but you can checkout some examples [here](https://github.com/laurci/ts-fork-demos).

Some features that I implemented:
- [`defer` statements](https://github.com/laurci/ts-fork-demos/tree/master/examples/defer)
